      <h1>History</h1>
      <p>Sri Krishnadevaraya University in Anantapur, Andhra Pradesh, was founded on July 25, 1981. It was established as a public university and is named after a patron of learning and the arts, Sri Krishnadevaraya, of the Vijayanagara Empire of the 16th century. The university is an offshoot of the erstwhile Postgraduate Centre of Sri Venkateswara University, which started in 1968. The university attained autonomous status in 1976 and became an affiliating university in 1988. It also started the Sri Krishnadevaraya Institute of Management with funding from the UGC in 1987. The Postgraduate Centre at Kurnool, previously under the jurisdiction of Sri Venkateswara University, was made over to Sri Krishnadevaraya University in 1993. The university has since expanded to include the Sri Krishnadevaraya University College of Engineering & Technology, which started in 2006 with self-finance. The university's campus spans over 482 acres and includes facilities such as a Science Instrumentation Centre, a Central Library, a Computer Centre, a Health Centre, a gymnasium, an outdoor stadium, an Auditorium, and space for departments of studies, laboratories, and housing for staff. The library has a collection of 13,600 back volumes, and the university offers Ph.D, M.Phil, Post Graduating, and Under Graduating courses through affiliated colleges as well as through the university itself.</p>
